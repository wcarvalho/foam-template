* how can an agent discover dynamics schemata
* we opine that the power and beauty of deep reinforcement learning is its ability to find solutions unimagined by the ever-so-clever AI researcher
* with that in mind, we develop the inductive biases for discovering dynamics schemata such that they offer a neural network maximum flexibility to discover a broad range of stereotyped patterns in dynamics
