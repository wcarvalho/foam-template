Difference in abstraction:

I am mainly looking for methods that can discover common features along trajectories

examples:
- discovering that different things which make sound can all be treated as instruments
  - humans learn the instrument cagtegory but then cleverly treat new objects (such as pots or buckets) as new instruments
  - importantly, they can transfer their knowledge of "object-state space traversal" across objects
    - e.g. a drummer can play a familiar song using pots and pans

I call this abstraction + generalization
I suspect that the same mechanisms that we use to abstract space (e.g. recognizing cities, recognizing towns, recognizing yards, recognizing lawns, recognizing canopies) are also used to abstract objects -- and interaction with them -- such as instruments




I think you've focused mainly on an AI/RL notion of abstraction, specifically state-abstraction. I think it's categorically different from what I (and what cognitive scientists) mean by abstraction/
  - you refer to abstracting all parts of the state-space to a single factor
  - I refer to abstracting common features from many instances of traversal through different parts of the state-space
    - this is what I mean by "schema".
    - schemas capture knowledge about traversal through the abstract space.
