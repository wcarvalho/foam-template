# What does apple look for?
Nominated students are selected based on their 
- research:
    - Novelty and relevance of the proposal,
    - scientific merit of the proposed approach,
    - potential for impact,
        - [relate to stereotyping + siri]
    - and alignment with research areas highlighted by ${company}.
- research field:
    - record as thought leaders and collaborators in their fields, 
    - impact the nominee has had on the field thus far (both as a researcher and community citizen)
    - unique commitment to take risks and push the envelope in machine learning and AI
        - pursued object-centric reinforcement learning in photo-realistic 3D environments before popular
            - this is a blossoming field
            - led to podcast interview as 2nd year Phd student + [invited talk](https://orlrworkshop.github.io/speakers.html) at workshop at NeurIPS as a 3rd year PhD student. both are uncommon occurrences.
- unique perspective and experience each nominee brings to the field
    - very few machine learning students trying to build towards human-level intelligence spent their childhood with their anthropology parents conducting fieldwork studying how humans learn to represent the world to choose their actions.
        - potentially few machine learning students are personally invested in developing AI that generalizes in the settings humans do in order to understand when human generalization can be faulty and socially harmful (especially because less than 2% of PhDs are black or hispanic, and 22% are women. of this a subset, is interested in developing AI towards understanding and mitigating stereotyping in society)

# What makes Wilka a strong researcher?


1. Deep Thinker:
    - example with Satinder: we once started discussing our choice of action-space for an object-oriented environment. Satinder was seeking clarity on how to specify the action-space we were using. Wilka conducted an in-depth literature review on how people have previously specified action-spaces with objects, created a taxonomy, positioned his within it, and wrote about the pros and cons associated with each. This was overkill for our needs but it shows the kind of thinker that Wilka is---he dives deeply into literature to deeply understand topics and their context.
    - 

2. Conducts thoughtful analyses
    - Object-Memory:
    - IJCAI Paper:
    - DeepMind Paper:

3. Seeks out truth instead of good results:
    - Object-Memory project:


4. Independent:
    - thought of and directed all his research ideas so far

5. Focused: 
    Example 1:
        - he's been thinking about how to learn representations over fragments of the environment that enable generalization and long-horizon planning since before he began his PhD
        - before began PhD, emailed Satinder [these questions](https://wcarvalho.github.io/misc/questions/) thinking about how humans structured representations of state that they coordinate with learned options (temporally extended behaviors) over to pursue long-term goals
        - for his first project, Wilka worked with a pretrained objectness detector (but not recognizer) and focused on learning an object-centric dynamics-model that enabled unsupervised representation learning that captured...
        - focused on asking deeper questions about the mechanisms that might subserve human representation and reinforcement learning, Wilka removed all assumptions on pretraining for his next project at DeepMind, and develop a recurrent memory architecture that was able to discover a broad range of structures in the environment including: 
        - now in his phd, he is continuing in this direction and starting to focus on how to leverage a mechanism which can discover structured state representations to discover temporally extended-behaviors
        - he has focused on the same, challenging research direction for the last 4 years
    Example 2:
        - Since the beginning of his PhD, he has expressed an interest in understanding what computational mechanisms lead humans to stereotype each other.
        - A black and hispanic student studying stem, this is something that he is personally familiar with.
        - His application to the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship was based on this, meaning that he's been thinking about this since 2015. He was awarded this fellowship.
        - Wilka is aware that that kind of human stereotyping that we think about with people is a subset of the kind of generalization abilities in humans that we don't yet understand.
        - In order to make progress on this, he has focused on developing AI that can generalize in the kinds of settings that humans can.
        - The research directions he pursues for advancing AI are informed by his interest in ultimately having AI algorithms that can generalize in the settings humans can: i.e., recognizing patterns in dynamics of animate objects and using that recognize and respond to discovered "types" of people based on shared behavioral dynamics.
        - Wilka is playing the long-game with developing AI that may one day be informative to understanding how humans successfully generalize but also unsuccessfully stereotype.

4. Fast Learner:
    - got acclimated to DeepMind codebase at a speed that shocked his team

5. Self Directed Learner:
    - concepts + categories class
    - Object-centric environments and literature  (not expertise of Satinder, Honglak, or Rick)
    - Attention-based Recurrent Memory Architectures (not expertise of Satinder, Honglak, or Rick)
    - GVFs
    - Schemata




6. Collaborator:
    - Collaborating with Lajan on leveraging language for compositional generalization in reinforcement learning
    - Collaborated with Sungryull + Jongwook on leveraging generalized value functions and planning to for Long-Horizon Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning

    More collaborator: 
        1. When I'm presented with ideas, I ask many, probing questions in order to understand the idea clearly. Historically, this has helped those I engage with also better understand what they are describing to me.
            - always seek to understand people's perspectives in discussions
        2. I approach problems from an interdisciplinary perspective and seek out the opinions of experts to supplement my own. I think this will and is enabling me to collaborate with people from varying fields and perspectives. For example, I sought out the perspective of David Fouhey to see how a core computer vision research saw the Thor domain, and to see what aspects of multi-view object recognition computer vision researchers still find challenging. Another example: in my proposal, I tie learning about novel categories or novel category views to learning learning about out-of-distribution data. To support this, I sought feedback from a knowledgable PhD student on the topic. As you know, I seek out discussion with a wide-variety of perspectives such as yourself, Honglak, Rick, Susan Gellman, etc. I hypothesize that this will foster interesting collaborations as I mature as a researcher.
