# Honglak's advice

AVOID REUSING TEXT ACROSS LETTER WRITERS

2. Description about the research/course project (1-2 paragraphs)
    - topic of your research/course project: 
        - discovering structured representations for 3D environments filled with many, dynamic objects that enable faster learning and improved generalization
    - why is it an interesting and important problem? what's the unique, interesting aspect of your project?
    - what is the challenging aspect of the problem?
    - how did you tackle the challenge? (key idea/theme/insight)
    - what task did you work on? how did your work contribute to the project? (please be very specific).
    - (very important) what are any impressive achievements in your project (both as individual and/or team)? Here, I am talking about *great and significant* results (not a laundry list of things you/your team did without great results). Ideally, here "great and significant" results should be something by which you can genuinely impress experts in machine learning and/or artificial intelligence, or experts in application domain.

* If you write these well, then it will be 1-2 paragraphs that
describe your research contribution in a self-contained way. I.e, it
should be understandable to outsiders (explain why it's
interesting/important problem, what approach he took, what results he
got, why the results are significant, etc.). Avoid redundancy and make
things flow logically.

3. strengths: what's your unique strengths that are evidenced by your performance in the class or interaction with me? You should be very specific and provide *evidence* to back up the statement.
    - If you itemize and describe details on the following points, it will be very helpful
        - intellectual independence
        - capacity for analytical thinking
        - technical ability
        - ability to work with others
        - ability to organize and express ideas clearly
        - drive and motivation
