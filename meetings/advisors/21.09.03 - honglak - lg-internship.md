# Messy

LGAI:
- 2 internally motivated projects:
    - Building chatbot for work → 
        - task desc → subtask graph
    - Troubleshooting →
        - Manufacturing issues + desc of problem
        - Perform reasoning + come up with solution
        - Requires:
            - Reasoning with multiple sources of information
- Problem:
    - If it’s research that I would do already, hard to sell
    - Beyond academic nature, relevant to internal problem
    - Delta from university project funded by LGAI
    - When  propose don’t say “compositional task generalization”
    - Maybe focus on option discovery
- Factors to consider:
    - 1. delta/different from univ project funded from LG
    - 2. relevance to company's internal projects/applications (vs academic research project)
    - 3. seperation from your previous deepmind project
        - Need clear separation
        - Work at deepmind shouldn’t count for LGAI
- Options:
    - Option-discovery
    - Discovering symbolic subtasks from text 
- Collaboration with Rick/Satinder:
    - Need 2 projects
