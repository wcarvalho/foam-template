1. {Pickup X, Avoid Y}, Schemas as Cumulants
2. Add tasks that require ordering:
  1. Place X
  2. Cook X
Two branches:
3a. Schemas as Cumulants + Combinatorial Planner (e.g. task-dependent weights, i.e. option-keyboar)
3b. Relational Schemas as Cumulants





How should we do updates?
1. Drive folder
  - slides
  - docs

2. Feel free to say:
  - I want this
  - I'm thinking of that
  - e.g. how to use the cumulants to learn policies? I see there's this GPI? Can you tell me weaknesses and strengths?

  - maybe makes more sense to meet more some weeks


1. share some best practices for learning gvfs/or successor features?
  - both given and discovered cumulants
  - given: standard
  - discovery

Angelos: how can he help me?
  - day-to-day help

- as long as learned cumulants + hard-coded preserve same information?
