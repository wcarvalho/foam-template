* worried that the kind of generalization will be solved soon
    * domain might be viewed as contrived

Honglak:
* short term viable project: seems there
* long term: high uncertainty

Satinder:
* is the story of generalization interesting?
    * concerned a lot of people are working on this kind of generalization? How long will this remain interesting?
    * my question: how many people are working on generalization of RL agent on tasks with a compositional structure?
        * generalizing  on tasks with compositional structure: codex. Trained on code snippets. Unsupervised but happens to have supervised via docstring + code.

Compare to open-world + codex. 

Rick:
* domain might be viewed as too contrived

Does this open things up for agent to master of kitchen domain?
