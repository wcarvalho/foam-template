- policy that follows plan
- given object type, policy moves agent to where object type is visible


Questions:
1. environment?
  Thor.
2. unseen layouts? Do well on Alfred.
  Unseen object layouts in known kitchens + unseen envs.
3. imitation learning + rl on top of that?
  Policy: takes subgoal sequence as input + executes them. mainly need to navigate towards objects.
  - Alfred codebase not built for RL.
  - task success rate
  - imitation learning won't cut it.
  - can assume oracle gives object labels.
  - can assume expert knowledge.

  - not looking at learning policies for task.
    - learn policies for navigating to object.
4. acl is in one month?



What is possible:
  1. given training (floorplans):
    - repeat until convergence:
      - randomize object layouts
      - sample random object
      - give object to agent as a task
      - agent trained to navigate to object

    - return policy parameters in pytorch
  2. policy:
    - train ppo policy
    - use an LSTM
  3. criteria:
    - gridSize=0.25 (Honglak: .1)
    - rotateStepDegrees=90 degrees (Honglak: 20)
    - look up/down=30 degrees (Honglak 20)
    - observation resolution=84x84 (Honglak: 200+)
    - observation = color
    - distance to object
      - visibilityDistance=1.5 (Honglak: 1)
      - field of view=90 (option larger field of view, smaller rotation size)
    - distance under which object ids are visible:
      - never given.

    - observation space:
       images
    - task space:
      object category
    - actions:
      MoveAhead, MoveBack, RotateRight, RotateLeft, LookUp, LookDown
      only navigation actions.
    - work with ai2thor 2.1.0
    - only sample objects that are not inside receptacles that have doors
    - want policy that can carry something and still navigate to object.
      - might want higher resolution or higher field of view

    - learning signal:
      - ppo agent that trains from scratch
      - multitask setting
      - env will have: farthest setting successful

TRAINING:
- successful distance = 2m
- episode:
  - sample floorplan
  - randomize object locations
  - randomize agent location
  - select object within successful distance
  - if object within success_distance + object_visible:
      done.
      successful distance += 1
  - repeat
