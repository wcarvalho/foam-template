I'm beginning this and you've been doing this for dozens of years.
1. developing AI that discover primitive reps + behaviors
  - discovering options
  - discovering objects/attributes
  - discovering structure over that (implicitly in a messy neural network way)
  - targetting weak inductive biases
  - suspect important part will be incorporating human experiments into this loop

Thoughts on how to do this?
Can you give concrete example?
  - data types is a good example.

Grammar + schemas + neural networks = separate things
- when introduce abstration, change the way you conceptualize.
