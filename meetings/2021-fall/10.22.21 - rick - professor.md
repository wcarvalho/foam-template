# Positioning self
- do great science, do great work, and all else will follow
	- become known for something
	- cog sci: how to become known?
		- cheap way: thought pieces aimed to cognitive science way?
			- opportunities + interesting questions.
		- expensive way: experimental work



# What should we do?
(paragraph or two with outline of ideas + connections I want to make)
- send Rick some notes on what are important fields for discovering composable primitives
- draw sharp contrasts to probabilistic programs
	- computational cognitive scientists that are interested in structure
	- how different, how complementary?



# Rick's class
- confluence of computation, cog sci, comp sci
- thursday: 10-15 minutes where chat
	- what will cog sci contribute?
	- what will AI contribute?



# Underrepresented Groups
- half women in {computation, philosophy} track
- black/latino:
	- slighlty bigger percentage
	- not making contact like we ought to
