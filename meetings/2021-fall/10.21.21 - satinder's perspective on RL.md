- barto, rich, doina, david, littman
  - rigor of language.
    - loose language is example.
    - should be no ambiguity about technical terms.
    - should be crystal clear about technical terms.

  - particular notion of 
    - state:
    - model:
    - RL is fundamentally about: problem of learning from online interactions.
    - role of model building?
    - role of predictions?
  - strong aversion to our scientific understanding being built into agents.
    - building in or expecting computational agents to recover
  - causality is silly:
    - time is fundamental.
    - just about predictions.
    - there are actions + action-conditional predictions.
  - knowledge:
    - starts with sensorimotor knowledge which is **predictions**
  - discrete/"shared" knowledge is last layer

  - goal: 
    - agents with rich knowledge + skills

- peter abbeel/sergey levine:
  - imitation, offline, 
- third: RL is good.


Q: can we make intentional time to learn your RL perspective?

  - powerful: mind with lots of potential
  - impressive: very skilled


tools + math of {game theory}/{multi-agent RL} is great for theory of RL
- nash equilibria++
- analysis tool
- follow the leader is powerful. shocking simple.
- linear programming
