To illustrate example perceptual schemata that can be discovered and how they may be recomposed in novel ways, we draw a simplified cartoon of one our tasks, the Ballet Task (\S \ref{sec:experiments-ballet}). During training, the agent observes up to $N_{\tt train}$ (e.g. 2) dancers at a time, which perform a dance over the course of 16 time-steps. Each dance is sampled from a fixed distribution of dances $d_i \sim p(D)$. During training, the agent observes N_{\tt train} (e.g. 2) randomly placed dancers. During testing, the agent will observe $N_{\tt test} > N_{\tt train}$ dancers (e.g. 4, 6, 8). \footnote{For simplicity in this example, we focus on a task where perceptual schemata are defined only over observations, though they in principle can be over observation, action, and reward.} In one generalization setting, the dancers dance in parallel. During testing, effectively learning perceptual schemata for motions defined over fragments of the observation enables the agent to recognize the schemata in novel spatial co-occurrences. In another generalization setting, the dancers dance in sequence. During testing, effectively learning perceptual schemata enables the agent to recognize the schemata in novel temporal occurrences and with novel schemata history lengths.
