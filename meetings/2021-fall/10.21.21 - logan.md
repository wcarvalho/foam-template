# Deep RL
- long-horizon makes sense

- what would the primitive even be?

- three-splot in weightlifting

- composability: subsequences

- give vivid imagary of examples




# Cog Sci
- People might bring past representations from previous episodes.


- How do humans recognize primitives from previous episodes?



Important Info:
  - just because you know primitive doesn't mean you know how to compose it
  - top-down and bottom-up
  - bottom-up:  
    - notice feature over and over again
    - frequency + salience + relevance to reward --> lead to discovery
  - top-down:
    - once primed to look for something, then you see it
      - e.g. tells you via language
      - e.g. you see someone do something, copy it blindly, and realize it's useful
      - e.g. goal effects which known primitives that are avaialble are seen as relevant towards goal-directed behavior
        - e.g. hammer entails nails
      - e.g. if nail is out of wall and told to hit in, you say "let's use shoe as hammer" --> novel composition 
        - e.g. top-down helps us find novel applications of causality we've learned. maybe this causality is a composition.


Experiment:
- constraints ob object types + verbs
- constraints on verbs being composed together
  - can't fry a boiled egg, can't boil a fried eggg



Logan Walls:
  - they went for rows first
  - they went for columns first
  - actions --> behaviors --> types of goal states --> final goal
    --> e.g. move forward
