# Todo:
1. think about speakers to invite
2. think about panel
  - tailor discussions to speakers + participants
3. schedule:
  - how long does everyone talk?
  - breaks/poster sesssion
4. Papers:
  - causal representation learning
  - object reps has bit in composionality
  - epilogue: bayesian reasoning
  - learning networks of relations/causality that genalize to new situations

# Talking Shit

1. How do you learn if you've learned a good object-representation?
  - learn classifier?
  - generalization to seens with more objects?

- shadows
- rainbows
- waterfall
- "a whole"


# Directions

Causality + Objects
- where do important factors come from? Reward.

- goal: how could interact and profit from one another?

objects = how to discover important factors
  - can be understand "separately" from the environment
  - objects are about modularization
    - factorizes world model into parts you can model independently
      - but make mistakes by treating them separately
      - because they do interact
      - relations is important given by causality
      - there are also statistical correlations
causality = learning a model that generalizes
  - how to learn networks of relations that generalize to new situations






# Speakers

- 6 speakers: {causality, objects, + outside}
  - developmental psych: gopnik
  - brian campbell smith: philosophy
    - create ontology for objects without assuming objects
      - we use objects in our thinking extensively
      - don't assume, how do we construct notion of object


  - speaker that provides objects as epiphenomenal?
  - bernard Sholkoff: causal rep learning
  - Yoshua bengio: causality + objects recently:
  - rosemary ke: causality


  Perspectives I care about:
  - symbols
  - abstraction

  - object/state vs reference/symbol
              abstraction connects them

  - rewards + objects (i.e. for discovery)
  - events: 
    - temporal objects (?)
    - causal temporal objects (?)
      - stone hits window
      - stone flys by window
      - why are they different?
  - behavior:
    - another temporal abstraction?

# Proposal
- abstract
- call
- bios
- schedule
- diversity statement
