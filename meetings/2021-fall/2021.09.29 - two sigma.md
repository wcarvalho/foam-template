# Clear
* my paragraph
    * what has field tried so far?
        * where is it stuck?
        * why do you have the magic sauce to get it unstuck
        * clearly explain *what* you do (not how)
            * e.g. humans have the ability to discover the basic pieces that describe their environment
                * they recognize that there are objects and object categories
                * they recognize that objects within a category have the same dynamics
                * they learn that objects with a similar shape tend to belong to the same category
                * they use this to quickly learn about the world and to generalize their knowledge to new situations
                * how do we get AI to do this?
                * cognitive scientists argue that part of how humans accomplish this...
                    this is what's unclear... how do you go from what's missing to abstract pieces?
                    * NOT CLEAR STILL: cognitive scientists argue that humans can accomplish this with 2 skills.
                        (1) they have core abstract primitive ways of representing pieces in the world
                        (2) they have core methods for combining these primitives to recognize instances in the world
                * rather than build in 
                    (1) core abstract primitive ways of representing the world,
                    (2) core methods for how to combine those primitives to
                * I would like to have algorithm that given a large amount of experience on challenging tasks, 
                    can discover useful primitives and ways of composing them that allow them to do even harder tasks

* fintech paragraph
    * things to avoid: saying obvious/dumb/nonsense/niche problems
        * avoid by being too specific
        * keep it general and talk about general things your method could help model in finance
            * relationships between entities
            * recognizing that streams of data all come from one entity
            * learning to model the dynamics of interactions of entities

# Raw

Despite progress of AI, doesn't learn as quickly or generalize as effectively as people.

Have PhD students read it back to you



How do we get AI to discover primitive representation

How do humans do this...
Humans 








first paragraph is *super abstract*
- *into deep learning*
- *have them read 1st paragraph, and have them explain idea to me*


risk of:
- if it's obvious/dumb/nonsense/problem is niche, --> makes you look bad
    - tried before
    - doesn't make sense
    - problem:
        - say what, but in specific example
        e.g. think about relationship between financial entities vs. roles in game-theoretic 
            - for first don't get "this is niche" problem


Paragraphs 1+ 2:
* general advice:
    * this is what RL has tried to do
        * this is where it got stuck
    * generalization: focused on this in such a setting
        * learn and generalize across a range of environments/tasks
    * **clearly** explain what you do
        * develop

fintech:
* while I admit that I'm not an expert in financial technology, I hypothesize that my research has

absolute notes:
    * clearly explain what you do + why important
    * why what you do, how does it relate to financial technology
        * don't need concrete problem



* I work on learning algorithms that can discover primitives in 

* too broad:
    * very general --> 2nd paragraph


* too specific:
    * abstract primitives
    * fintech application
