# Lesson
When we begin to pursue our ideals, we have certain conscious motivations, such as advancing knowledge.

If advancing our ideals requires or benefits from us rising in some hierarchy and being higher in this hierarchy comes with other benefits such as wealth, fame, or other status, then we risk other subconscious motivations guiding our behavior. For example, things that fame or wealth bring us might guide our actions instead of our initial ideal.

1.  try to maintain network of people that come from a diverse part of hierarchy (or diverse set of social groups)
    
    1.  connect with people outside of your scope of influence
        
    2.  can more easily get feedback from people who aren't not biased in your favor
        
    3.  reconnect with early stage thinking
        
2.  people get too confident in themselves and they are right and they know the right way
    
    1.  **beginner's mindset**
        
    2.  **growth mindset**
        
    3.  _learning new uncomfortable things_
        
    4.  not just new technology, but also challenges your approach to life.
        
        1.  things you think are obviously correct and incorrect things
