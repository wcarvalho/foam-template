1. School, Department. This is why we invited them.
2. Put in perspective of workshop. Commit speakers to present their work through the lense of causality of objects. 
  - discourage submission of already presented work
  - trust in speakers

1. diversity of backgrounds:
  - me: reinforcement learning
  - kipf: graph neural networks
  - franc

2. ethnicity:
  - Black + Hispanic
  - Tong: chinese
  - German: Klauss, Sindy, Thomas
  - Southern European: Italian


3. Outreach plan:
  - Intend to broadcase via these channels:
    - BlackInAI: increase diversity if audience
    - Khipu: increase diversity if audience
    - Nosa
