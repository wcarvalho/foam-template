how to resolve spatial hierarchy: 
    - get people to draw pictures
    - arrange (circles, triangles, etc.) to draw
        - do they fill in micro/macro structure first?


how do humans abstract + compose:
    - dimension along we do that is neither purely spatial or temporal
    - e.g. bank breaks this.




assume: convert kitchen environment.
    - need human to do task
        - need input method of some kind
    - might want human to describe behavior of policy



idea:
    - have human look at trained agent do level 1 or 2 tasks
        - tell them watching bot
        - show them basic behaviors in order to teach them how env works
    - ask them to describe what they see
    - biasing them to.
        - start them cold. say nothing. let them explore.
    after:
        - ask them to do very long horizon task
            - ask them to descibe how they did long-horizon task
        - ask them to predict what agent would do on novel problem

What question am i trying to answer:
    - what primitives do people learn?
        *MOST IMPORTANT*
    - how do they compose them?

primitives might be sequences of actions:
    - record their history of input
    - 

primitive 1: summary of what's happened




- overview of the work
- what novel parts are
