3. [ ] Experiments
   1. [x] Implement wide + deep models
      1. [x] compare big sizes: xl-wide, xl-deep, xl-deepwide, deep conv-lstm, deep lstm (basically same size)
   2. [x] Ballerina task: (2,4) --> 6,8
      1. [x] sequential
         1. [x] generalize
      2. [ ] parallel
         1. [x] generalize
         2. [x] just-train
   4. [x] Object permanence
   3. [ ] Playroom generalization (Kyriacos's tasks)
4. [ ] Workshop Paper
   1. [ ] Methods
   3. [ ] Experiments
      1. [ ] Create figures from experiments and place them into latex doc
   3. [ ] Different perspectives of introduction:
      1. [ ] Unsupervised RL: cog-sci perspective: chomsky/fodor
         1. [ ] prior work on systematic generalization
      2. [ ] Reinforcement Learning for Real Life Workshop: missing ability to capture dynamics
      3. [ ] time-series modeling. application: RL.
5. [ ] Analysis
   1. [ ] do different schema map to different ballerina?
   2. [ ] how are the schema used in the keybox task?
6. [ ] ICLR
