# Research Project
1. Survey (1-2 pages)  
- read 6-8 relevant papers. should provide answers to (some of) following:
	-   What is the common theme of the papers you read? Give the problem definition(s).
	-   What are the challenges of the area?
	-   How do the papers relate to each other?
	-   Are they solving a new problem or improving an existing method?
	-   What are the main techniques that they are using?
	-   What are 3 strengths and 3 weaknesses of each paper?
	-   What are the limitations of each method?
	-   Think about some future directions. What would you do better?
1. easy + medium gridworld-experiment with reasonable/strong baseline (strong is safer)
2. workshop paper
3. hard gridworld-experiment with strong baseline
4. easy + medium 3D-env-experiment w/ strong baseline
5. Analysis (stronger if scientific)
6. archive paper
	- draft
	- website
		- generate videos of agent
	- tweet
7. rebuttal
8. create poster
9. create 10-20 minute video


# Environments
1. [Optional] Create environment
	1. 
2.  create {easy, medium, hard} tasks
	1.  Design (folder of) curricula for each task setting
3.  benchmark {baselines} on tasks
	1.  Implement Baseline
