-   ability to discover composable primitive representations important for society
-   ability to discover composable primitive representations facilitate generalization and goal-completion over long time-horizons
-   Weak inductive biases are key to algorithms that can discover composable primitives.
-   should place a larger emphasis on developing weak inductive biases for RL
-   deep RL is missing a large, rich env



goal:
- ability to discover and compose primitive representations is supported by weak inductive biases


- deep learning has shown that weak inductive biases can enable the discovery o
