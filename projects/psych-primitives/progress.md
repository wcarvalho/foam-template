- [[10.15.21 - rick meeting]] 
- [[10.14.21 - main v1 | notes]]
- [ ] papers: action hiearchies session in chrome
- [ ] Write-up concrete example of two subjects "carving up" a single test task in two ways?
	- [ ] what primitives *might* they discover?
		- [ ] what kind of hiearchy might they use?
		- [ ] how do two trees lead to different *empirical* observations about behavior?
			- [ ] different within task behavior
			- [ ] different generalization (e.g. do the hiearchies they use for length 3 indicate the hiearchies they use for length 4? are those hiearchies *shared*?)
			- [ ] be concrete using: action-sequence/generalization-sequence?
	- [ ] present: concrete image, observation
