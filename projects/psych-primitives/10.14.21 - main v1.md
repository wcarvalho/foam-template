## Research Question

How do people segment their experience into reusable chunks or subgoals to enable
1. rapid learning in a multitask setting
2. zero-shot/few-shot generalization 

In particular, what kind of primitive representations of subgoals do people create/discover and reuse to quicken generalization?

## Literature to Explore

1. How people segment their experimence?
	1. How people discover events?
	2. How do people discover primitive representations? Primitive events?
2. How do people discover subgoals? [[Options]]?
	1.  How people create [[action-hierarchies]]?
	2.  How do people use hiearchical reinforcement learning?
	3.  How do people learn abstractions?
3.  Work on problem solving?
	1.  Work on thinking aloud.




## Experiment
[[#Environment Details]] in Appendix

Goal: create a train/test task setup where agents benefit from creating/discovering (potentially compositional) primitives for subgoals that aid in faster/zero-shot learning of test tasks. Outline of tasks, rewards, and mechanisms to inspect discovered/constructed primitives.

**Train/test setup**. Tasks are organized by rough "length". Tasks are compositional: test tasks are compositions of observed behaviors in train tasks. 
- train tasks: length $L$ = {1,2,3}. e.g. cook egg in pan. These tasks should last up to a couple of minutes.
- test tasks: length $L$ = {4,5,6}. e.g. cook sliced potato in pan[^1]. These tasks should take many minutes (potentially up to 10s of minutes). 


**Reward**. 
- train: given large budget of time with no time-limit per task. Completion reward $r=k_{\tt train}L$
	- Told that train tasks are "training".
- test: finite time-budget per task and completion reward $r=k_{\tt test}L^3$
	- Test tasks are long so they benefit from breaking up their goal-directed behavior into subgoals.

### Inspecting discovered primitives
We will use a "Think-aloud protocol" where we ask subjects to explain the subgoals they are currently following. We *might* say that these subgoals are inteneded to be used to teach AI or humans to perform these tasks. 

**Option 1**. 

Have subjects repeat the following until finished
1. describe subgoal
2. take actions
3. press done when subgoal finished

Conditions: 
1. no reflection
2. reflection during
3. post-hoc reflection

**Option 2**.
- Subjects can record as many subgoals into "repository" of subgoals during training.
- During testing, subjects can "activate" and "deactivate" as many subgoals as they want. Activating a subgoal brings it next to their observation.

Conditions:
1. no repository
2. repository can only be written in during training (this alone probably helps?)
3. repository available to select goals during testing



## Measurements + predictions
**studying policy learning**:
success rate, wall time, action-sequence length for tasks
- stratify these measurements by task "length"
- predictions:

**studying primitive learning**:
length of time subgoals are active + number of active subgoals
- predictions:

**studying learned hiearchy of primitives**:
- subgoal order
- subgoal length
- subgoal co-occurrence?
	
	 

## Other predictions about results

**predictions about abstract subgoal representations $\phi$**
* $\phi$ is discrete + compositional
* abstract state representations are *subset* of goal representations (e.g. non state-goal "moving forward"): $\phi_s \subset \phi$

question: how to confirm/explore?

**predictions about how people learn**:
- people begin with reactive policy until they learn dynamics for this part of "task space"
	- people repeat the following until task completion:
		- *potentially* attempt to plan with a model
		- follow plan reactively or use reactive policy
		- people adapt plan based on observations
	- as people get better, they swtich from $$\{\phi_i\}\sim\pi(\phi|s)$$ to $$\{s_i\}\sim p(s'|s, \phi\sim\pi(s))$$ and back

# Appendix

## Environment Details
- Environment: grid-world kitchen environment
	- action names, object names, and object images will be systematically replaced with made up words and fake images
- Tasks: Compostional tasks 
 ![[Pasted image 20211014202746.png]]
	- features:
		- tasks are compostional
		- object-dynamics are shared across tasks (e.g. cooking dynamics)

## Thrown out
Human subjects will be given a large budget of time to learn a set of training tasks. Each task they complete will earn them a small monetary reward in proportion to a tasks length (e.g. $r_T=k_{\tt train}L$). They will be instructed that this is training for a "test setting" where they will get significantly more reward (e.g. $r_T=k_{\tt test}L^3$). Test tasks will take up to many minutes to complete, so they benefit from breaking up their goal-directed behavior into following a set of subgoals.

[^1]: Test tasks are not simply sequential compositions of shorter subtasks because subtask order matters due to causality. E.g., place cooked egg on table requires first cooking an egg and then placing it on the table.
