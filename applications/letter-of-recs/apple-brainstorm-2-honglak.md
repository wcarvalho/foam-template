what's your unique strengths that are evidenced by your performance in the class or interaction with me? You should be very specific and provide *evidence* to back up the statement.

# drive, motivation, and intellectual independence
    * Wilka is very independent intellectually.
    * Throughout his PhD, he has shown strong drive and motivation towards pursuing his intellectual interests.


    5. Focused: 
        Example 1:
            - he's been thinking about how to learn representations over fragments of the environment that enable generalization and long-horizon planning since before he began his PhD
            - before began PhD, emailed Satinder [these questions](https://wcarvalho.github.io/misc/questions/) thinking about how humans structured representations of state that they coordinate with learned options (temporally extended behaviors) over to pursue long-term goals
            - for his first project, Wilka worked with a pretrained objectness detector (but not recognizer) and focused on learning an object-centric dynamics-model that enabled unsupervised representation learning that captured...
            - focused on asking deeper questions about the mechanisms that might subserve human representation and reinforcement learning, Wilka removed all assumptions on pretraining for his next project at DeepMind, and develop a recurrent memory architecture that was able to discover a broad range of structures in the environment including: 
            - now in his phd, he is continuing in this direction and starting to focus on how to leverage a mechanism which can discover structured state representations to discover temporally extended-behaviors
            - he has focused on the same, challenging research direction for the last 4 years
        Example 2:
            - Since the beginning of his PhD, he has expressed an interest in understanding what computational mechanisms lead humans to stereotype each other.
            - A black and hispanic student studying stem, this is something that he is personally familiar with.
            - His application to the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship was based on this, meaning that he's been thinking about this since 2015. He was awarded this fellowship.
            - Wilka is aware that that kind of human stereotyping that we think about with people is a subset of the kind of generalization abilities in humans that we don't yet understand.
            - In order to make progress on this, he has focused on developing AI that can generalize in the kinds of settings that humans can.
            - The research directions he pursues for advancing AI are informed by his interest in ultimately having AI algorithms that can generalize in the settings humans can: i.e., recognizing patterns in dynamics of animate objects and using that recognize and respond to discovered "types" of people based on shared behavioral dynamics.
            - Wilka is playing the long-game with developing AI that may one day be informative to understanding how humans successfully generalize but also unsuccessfully stereotype.


    * thought of and directed his research projects so far
    * actively pursues his diverse intellectual interests -- e.g. took class on concepts and categories by renowned psychologist Susan Gellman in order to inform his work on how AI may discover rich abstractions for the environment.

# capacity for analytical thinking
    2. Conducts thoughtful analyses:
        - Object-Memory:
        - IJCAI Paper:
        - DeepMind Paper:

    3. Seeks out truth instead of good results:
        - Object-Memory project:

# technical ability
    - Writing modular code: {tested many ideas thanks to modular code}
    - Writing scientifically:
    - routinely ask him to work on grant applications

# ability to work with others

    6. Collaborator:
        - Collaborating with Lajan on leveraging language for compositional generalization in reinforcement learning
        - Collaborated with Sungryull + Jongwook on leveraging generalized value functions and planning to for Long-Horizon Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning
    - Learning about external memory systems: Jongwook

    - identifying areas of growth + seeking out mentorship:
        - strives to reflect on his areas of growth and act on that.
        - modular coding: (have elite labmates that won ICCP, Jongwook mentored him on coding)
        - Developing his research skills: senior students Kimin Lee + Sungrull Sohn
        - writing papers: actively sought feedback from senior students in beginning of PhD

# ability to organize and express ideas clearly
- good writer
- his presentation on a research proposal at the end of his 1st year was one of the best proposal I'd seen by an undergraduate
- he presents his progres clearly. led to object-model idea. 

- time managment
