        - Collaborating with Lajan on leveraging language for compositional generalization in reinforcement learning
        - Collaborated with Sungryull + Jongwook on leveraging generalized value functions and planning to for Long-Horizon Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning
    - Learning about external memory systems: Jongwook

    - identifying areas of growth + seeking out mentorship:
        - strives to reflect on his areas of growth and act on that.
        - modular coding: (have elite labmates that won ICCP, Jongwook mentored him on coding)
        - Developing his research skills: senior students Kimin Lee + Sungrull Sohn
        - writing papers: actively sought feedback from senior students in beginning of PhD

# ability to organize and express ideas clearly
- good writer
- his presentation on a research proposal at the end of his 1st year was one of the best proposal I'd seen by an undergraduate
- he presents his progres clearly. led to object-model idea. 

- time managment
