* deep thinker. He will do deep literature reviews and analyses to follow up our discussions 

* does quantitative analysis on his research that researchers find interesting (and compelling)

* independent researcher - has designed all of his projects including a successful deepmimd project 

* fast learner - got acclimated to deepmind env quickly 

* wilka is a focused researcher. He has been thinking about how to learn abstractions of observation-action sequences over aspects of the environment since the onset of his PhD. This first began as him working with a preordained object detector and learning a model which enabled unsupervised representation learning that captured...

* having thought about this deeply, his latest project has removed assumptions of an object detector and instead had a small set of weak inductive biases that enabled learned observation-action sequence Representations that ...


# What does apple look for?
Nominated students are selected based on their 
- research:
    - Novelty and relevance of the proposal,
    - scientific merit of the proposed approach,
    - potential for impact,
        - [relate to stereotyping + siri]
    - and alignment with research areas highlighted by ${company}.
- research field:
    - record as thought leaders and collaborators in their fields, 
    - impact the nominee has had on the field thus far (both as a researcher and community citizen)
    - unique commitment to take risks and push the envelope in machine learning and AI
        - pursued object-centric reinforcement learning in photo-realistic 3D environments before popular
            - this is a blossoming field
            - led to podcast interview as 2nd year Phd student + [invited talk](https://orlrworkshop.github.io/speakers.html) at workshop at NeurIPS as a 3rd year PhD student. both are uncommon occurrences.
- unique perspective and experience each nominee brings to the field
    - very few machine learning students trying to build towards human-level intelligence spent their childhood with their anthropology parents conducting fieldwork studying how humans learn to represent the world to choose their actions.
        - potentially few machine learning students are personally invested in developing AI that generalizes in the settings humans do in order to understand when human generalization can be faulty and socially harmful (especially because less than 2% of PhDs are black or hispanic, and 22% are women. of this a subset, is interested in developing AI towards understanding and mitigating stereotyping in society)
