<!-- Central question: can a structured agent-state representation enable systematic generalization? we hypothesis that one ability that would help is the ability to carve up experience into dynamics schemata. -->
story for paper: recognition of dynamics schemata. sports. recognizing facial expressions. thereâ€™s so many. Why is this useful? Systematic generalization because you can break up the environment and compose them to more represent unknown situations.

## Background

1. Convolutional LSTMs: equation + 1 paragraph explaining how they track dynamics of features
2. Convolutional Attention: equation + 1 paragraph explaining how they track pieces of observation

## Method
While we focus on vision experiments, we note that this could very well extend towards audio by replacing all 2D convolutions with 1D convolutions
