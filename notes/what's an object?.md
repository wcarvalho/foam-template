What are [[objects]]?

An object is a reference to a fragment of the environment. How can you represent objects? It's not clear but the beginning seems to involve a segment of sensory features defined over time in some way. These features can be stationary (e.g. a box) or dynamic (e.g. a ballerina). When an object is interacted with, the fragment of the environment they refer to is changed. How might objects be discovered? From a [[causality]] perspective, when an agent intervenes on an object, that part of the environment might change in such a way that downstream dynamics lead the agent to experience reward. The agent needs to discover how interventions on [[fragments]] of the environment lead it to experience reward.

1. How does an [[object]] differ from a [[schema]]?
2. How does a [[schema]] differ from an [[option]]?
