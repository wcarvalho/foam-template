# Can attention describe the activation of options or schemas?

[[schema]] [[option]] [[attention]]

## Ugly first pass
Initiation set: attention to state. Dynamics = update function. Termination set = no more attention. Have a set of states over which you're active defined by set of states for which your attention results in non-zero input. Verify this on ballerina. If this is what happens: extremely compelling story.
